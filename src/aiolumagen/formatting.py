"""Decoders for Lumagen wire codes.

The Lumagen encodes several values in ways that are not directly usable:
refresh rates arrive as 3-digit *truncated* integers (``059`` means 59.94),
aspect ratios as hundredths without a separator (``178`` means 1.78), and the
output-enable set as a 16-bit hex bitmask. Horizontal resolution isn't
reported at all — only vertical resolution and raster aspect, from which the
width has to be derived.

This module is **decoding, not display formatting**. Every function returns a
number (or a tuple of numbers), never a human-readable string: rounding,
units, and localisation are the consumer's business. That keeps the boundary
in ``structure.md`` intact — enum values and display strings stay out of the
library.

Both non-obvious derivations — the NTSC rate family and width-from-aspect —
are documented at their definitions, including why snapping to a standard
width is tolerance-bounded rather than nearest-match (see
:func:`derive_horizontal_resolution`).

"""Truncated rate codes belonging to the NTSC ``/1.001`` family.

The Lumagen reports vertical rate as the *truncated* integer part of the real
rate, so the fractional NTSC rates all appear one below their nominal value:
``059`` is 59.94, not 59. Each of these decodes as ``(code + 1) / 1.001``:

===== ============ =========
Code  Nominal      Actual
===== ============ =========
023   24           23.976
029   30           29.970
047   48           47.952

119   120          119.880
===== ============ =========

Using the ``/1.001`` derivation rather than a hand-written lookup table means
the high-rate modes a Radiance Pro supports are covered without anyone having
to remember to extend a dict. Tip0011 only documents ``059``/``060`` by
example, so the rest follow the rule rather than the doc.

    The Lumagen reports only vertical resolution (``VVVV``) and raster aspect

    aspect code carries just two decimal places, so the raw product is off by
    a few pixels (``2160 x 1.78 = 3844.8``); when the result lands within
    :data:`SNAP_TOLERANCE` of a value in :data:`COMMON_WIDTHS` it snaps to
    that value, recovering the exact standard width.

    Outside that tolerance the computed width is returned as-is. Snapping
    unconditionally to the nearest common width is the obvious implementation
    and it's wrong: it turns an unusual but correct raster into a wrong
    standard one, reporting a 5120-wide ultrawide as 4096 — a 20% error
    presented as though it were exact. Refusing the snap keeps the error
    bounded by the aspect code's own precision instead.

    Returns ``None`` when either field is missing, non-numeric, or zero (the
    device's no-signal placeholder).

    Note this is *display geometry*, not necessarily the transmitted pixel
    count: 480i is 720 pixels wide with non-square pixels but a 4:3 raster,
